	•	Sorting lists in ascending and descending order using sorted()
	•	Using while loops with break to control repetition
	•	Using for loops to iterate over lists
	•	Handling user input and converting data types (string to int)
	•	Using conditional statements if / elif / else for decision making
	•	Comparing numeric values (greater than, less than, equal to)
	•	Creating and using functions to modify lists
	•	Understanding how lists are modified when passed to functions
	•	Checking if an element exists in a list using in
